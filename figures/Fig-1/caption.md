**Figure 1: CaM knock-down reduces Orco levels in OSN dendrites and odor responsiveness.**
**A.** Schematic detailing the temperature changes used to restrict CaM knock-down to adult olfactory neurons.
At 18ºC, tub-GAL80^ts represses Peb-GAL4's activation of CaM-IR expression.
Between 0 and 12 hours APF, as adult OSN development is beginning, we moved the Peb-GAL4,tub-GAL80^ts;UAS-CaM-IR flies from 18ºC to 29ºC to inactivate GAL80 and activate CaM knock-down ("CaM-IR ON").
"CaM-IR OFF" control flies were maintained at 18ºC throughout adulthood.
**B--C.** Staining of antennal sections from Peb-GAL4,UAS-Dcr-2/+; tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/UAS-CaM-IR; UAS-myR::GFP/+ flies with an Orco-specific antibody. Scale bars, 10 μm.
**B.** Control flies maintained the entire time at 18 degrees show normal localization of Orco in the OSN cell bodies and dendrites.
**C.** CaM RNAi flies show fairly normal, albeit slightly reduced, staining of Orco in the OSN cell bodies, but dramatically reduced staining in the dendrites.
This occurs despite normal OSN dendritic morphology, confirmed by visualizing co-expressed myR::GFP.
**D.** SSR trace of a normal ab2 sensilla.
**E.** Trace of a non-responsive sensilla found in CaM RNAi flies.
**G.** Proportion of responsive large basiconic sensilla.
While 100 percent of the sensilla on all control flies showed normal responsiveness, flies with Pebbled-Gal4-driven CaM RNAi at the onset of OSN development showed a severe reduction in the proportion of responsive sensilla.
Mean+- SEM. N=5. Exact genotypes of flies used are as follows: Peb-Gal4, UAS-Dcr2/+ (X); Tub-Gal80/CaM RNAi (II) (18 degree controls and experimental), Peb-Gal4, UAS-Dcr2/+ (X); Tub-Gal80/+ (II), and CaM RNAi/+ (II).
