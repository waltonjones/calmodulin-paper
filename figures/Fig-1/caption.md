**Figure 1: CaM knock-down reduces Orco levels in OSN dendrites and odor responsiveness.**

**A.** Schematic detailing the temperature changes used to restrict CaM knock-down to adult olfactory neurons.
At 18ºC, tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup> represses _Peb-GAL4_'s activation of _CaM-IR_ expression.
Between 0 and 12 hours APF, as adult OSN development is beginning, we moved the _Peb-GAL4,tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>;UAS-CaM-IR_ flies from 18ºC to 29ºC to inactivate GAL80 and activate CaM knock-down ("CaM-IR ON").
We maintained "CaM-IR OFF" control flies at 18ºC throughout adulthood.
**B--C.** Staining of antennal sections from _Peb-GAL4,UAS-Dcr-2/+; tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/UAS-CaM-IR; UAS-myR::GFP/+_ flies with an Orco-specific antibody. Scale bars, 10 μm.
**B.** "CaM-IR OFF" control flies show strong Orco signal in both the OSN cell bodies and sensory dendrites.
**C.** "CaM-IR ON" flies show little to no change in Orco staining in the OSN cell bodies, but substantially reduced staining in the dendrites (left).
This occurs despite normal OSN dendritic morphology, confirmed via visualization of the membrane-tethered myR::GFP (right).
**D.** Sample spike trace from a typical "CaM-IR OFF" ab2 sensillum. Note the large ab2A spikes and the smaller ab2B spikes.
**E.** Sample trace from a non-responsive, and hence unidentifiable, large basiconic "CaM-IR OFF" sensillum.
**F.** Percentage of large basiconic sensilla from flies of the indicated genotypes maintained at the indicated temperatures showing spontaneous spiking activity.
While all sensilla from the control flies show normal spontaneous action potentials, this is reduced to ~50% in "CaM-IR ON" flies.
Data are presented as means ± standard error, n = 5 flies, 10 sensilla for each genotype.
We used the following precise genotypes: [_Peb-GAL4, UAS-Dcr-2/+ (X); tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+ (II)_], [_UAS-CaM-IR/+ (II)_], and [_Peb-GAL4, UAS-Dcr-2/+ (X); tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/CaM-IR (II)_].
