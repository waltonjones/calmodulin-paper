**Figure 2: Putative CBS in Orco is highly conserved.**

**A.** Orco snake plot with each amino acid color-coded according to its level of conservation across 78 Orco orthologues.
The indicated intracellular CaM binding site (CBS) is among the most highly conserved regions of Orco.
**B.** Sequences of the wild type Orco CBS in the Orco^WT transgene, the N-terminal and C-terminal Orco CBS deletion mutant Orco^CBSΔ, the single tryptophan deletion mutant Orco^W341Δ, and the charge reversal mutant Orco^RH344EE. All the UAS-Orco transgenes we generated also have an N-terminal mCherry tag (not shown)
