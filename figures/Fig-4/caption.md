**Figure S1 Odor exposure in the absence of new Orco production accelerates the loss of existing dendritic Orco.**
**A.** Experimental scheme.
UAS-mCH::Orco^WT/Tub-Gal80^ts, OR22a-Gal4 (II); Tub-Gal80^ts, Orco^1 (III) flies were reared in 29 degrees until 3 days PE.
Then they were transferred to 18 degrees to block additional Orco expression and divided into two groups, one reared on normal food and the other reared on food containing an EP tube holding 1/10 EB.
**B--E.** 3 days and 9 days after transfer to 18 degrees and starting odorant exposure, Orco localization in the OSNs were observed by visualizing the mCherry fluorophore.
**B.** Antennal image of flies prior to transfer to 19 degrees.
**C.** Flies reared in 18 degrees show no Orco expression, indicating that the three copies of Tub-Gal80^ts are sufficient to completely block Orco expression at the restrictive temperature.
**D.** Blocking Orco production in the absence of EB exposure leads to a gradual loss of Orco first in the OSN cell bodies, which starts to manifest 3 days after transfer to 18 degrees (Left).
By day 9 in 18 degrees, Orco is completely degraded in the cell bodies and residual Orco can be seen only in the dendrites.
**E.** When Orco production is blocked in the presence of EB, a dramatic reduction in dendritic Orco, accompanied by relatively darker cell bodies, is noticeable by day 3 (Left).
(Right) By day 9, dendrites are almost depleted of Orco, while residual Orco is still readily visible in the OSN cell bodies.
**B--E.** are visualization of the mCherry tag on Orco which has been converted to inverted black and white images.
