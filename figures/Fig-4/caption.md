**Figure 4: Odor exposure in the absence of new Orco production accelerates the loss of existing dendritic Orco.**

**A.** Experimental scheme.
We maintained _UAS-mCherry::Orco<sup>WT</sup>/tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, Or22a-GAL4 (II); tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, Orco^1 (III)_flies at 29ºC until 3 days PE.
Then, after transferring them to 18ºC to block additional Orco expression, we divided the flies into two groups: those maintained on normal food and those maintained on food plus a perforated EP tube containing 10% ethyl butyrate.
**B--E.** Orco localization in ab3A dendrites determined by visualizing mCherry.
**B.** "Orco ON control" antennae prior to the transfer to 18ºC show clear ab3A cell body and dendritic localization of Orco.
**C.** "Orco OFF control" antennae from flies maintained continuously at 18ºC show no Orco expression, indicating three copies of tub-GAL80^ts are sufficient to completely block Orco expression at the restrictive temperature.
**D.** When new Orco production is blocked, existing Orco seems to gradually move from the ab3A cell bodies to the dendrites over time.
3 days after the transfer to 18ºC, the ab3A cell bodies show slightly less Orco and the dendrites slightly more (_left_).
By day 9, the ab3A cell bodies are empty while the dendrites show only slighly lower levels of Orco (_right_).
**E.** When new Orco production is similarly blocked in the presence of the ab3A ligand ethyl butyrate, the level of dendritic Orco significantly reduced even after only 3 days.
This is accompanied by enhanced ab3A cell body staining (_left_).
By day 9, both the ab3A cell bodies and dendrites are nearly depleted of Orco, while residual Orco is still readily visible in the OSN cell bodies.
For **B--E**, the color of each image is inverted to improve dendrite visibility.
