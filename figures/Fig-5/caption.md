**Figure 5: CaM knock-down reduces olfactory sensitivity in an activity-dependent manner.**

**A--B.** CaM knock-down after OR expression has begun using Orco-GAL4 does not affect the sensitivity of ab2A neurons to methyl acetate (**A**) and slightly reduces the sensitivity of ab3A neruons to ethyl butyrate (**B**).
**C.** In the extended presence of MA, Orco-Gal4 driven CaM RNAi leads to a severely reduced ab2A response.
**d** Similar reduction in olfactory response is seen in ab3A neurons upon extended exposure to EB.
Such reduction in olfactory response observed in Orco-Gal4>CaM RNAi flies upon prolonged odorant exposure is ORx-specific since MH, which highly activates ab3A but not ab2A neuron, induces **e** no reduction in ab2A response of Orco-Gal4> CaM RNAi flies but a **f** significant reduction in ab3A response. 
For all graphs, mean ± 95% confidence interval. n ≥ 8 for each data point.
The presence asterisks indicate significant differences between experimental and both control groups, where the higher p-value of the two are indicated by the number of asterisks (two-way ANOVA; Bonferroni post-hoc test; \* _p_ < 0.05, \*\* _p_ < 0.01, \*\*\* _p_ < 0.001).
Genotypes of the recorded flies are as follows: UAS-Dcr2/UAS-CaM RNAi(II); Orco-Gal4 (III), UAS-Dcr2/+ (II); Orco-Gal4 (III), and UAS-CaM RNAi/+ (II).
