Figure 4.
CaM knockdown leads to loss of olfactory response in an activity-dependent manner. **a** and **b** Without any extra odor present, late-onset CaM RNAi using Orco-G4 leads to no reduction or only a slight reduction in **a** ab2A and **b** ab3A neurons, respectively. **c** In the extended presence of MA, Orco-Gal4 driven CaM RNAi leads to a severely reduced ab2A response. **d** Similar reduction in olfactory response is seen in ab3A neurons upon extended exposure to EB. Such reduction in olfactory response observed in Orco-Gal4>CaM RNAi flies upon prolonged odorant exposure is ORx-specific since MH, which highly activates ab3A but not ab2A neuron, induces **e** no reduction in ab2A response of Orco-Gal4> CaM RNAi flies but a **f** significant reduction in ab3A response. 
For all graphs, mean +- 95% confidence interval. N>=8 for each data point. The presence asterisks indicate significant differences between experimental and both control groups, where the higher p-value of the two are indicated by the number of asterisks (two-way ANOVA; Bonferroni post-hoc test; *_p_<.05, **_p_<.01, ***_p_<.001). Genotypes of the recorded flies are as follows: UAS-Dcr2/UAS-CaM RNAi(II); Orco-Gal4 (III), UAS-Dcr2/+ (II); Orco-Gal4 (III), and UAS-CaM RNAi/+ (II).
