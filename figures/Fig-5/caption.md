**Figure 5: CaM knock-down reduces olfactory sensitivity in an activity-dependent manner.**

**A--B.** CaM knock-down after OR expression has begun using _Orco-GAL4_ does not affect the sensitivity of ab2A neurons to methyl acetate (**A**) and slightly reduces the sensitivity of ab3A neurons to ethyl butyrate (**B**).
**C.** When the same flies were maintained in vials containing 10% ethyl acetate, which activates ab2A, CaM knock-down produces a dramatic reduction in the sensitivity of ab2A neurons to methyl acetate.
**D.** When we maintained these flies in vials containing 10% ethyl butyrate, we observed a similar but even more significant reduction in the sensitivity of ab3A to ethyl butyrate.
**E--F.** This effect of CaM-IR is OSN subtype specific, as long-term exposure to 10% methyl hexanoate---a ligand for ab3A but not ab2A---does not affect ab2A sensitivity (**E**) but strongly reduces ab3A sensitivity (**F**). 
For all graphs, data are presented as means ± 95% confidence intervals.
n ≥ 8 sensilla for each genotype and each odor dose.
Asterisks indicate significant differences between the experimental line and both controls, with the higher of the two _P_-values determining the number of asterisks (two-way ANOVA; Bonferroni post-hoc test; \* _P_ < 0.05, \*\* _P_ < 0.01, \*\*\* _P_ < 0.001).
We used the following precise genotypes: [_UAS-Dcr-2/UAS-CaM-IR (II); Orco-GAL4 (III)_], [_UAS-Dcr-2/+ (II); Orco-GAL4 (III)_], and [_UAS-CaM-IR/+ (II)_].
