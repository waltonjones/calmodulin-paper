Figure 5. CaM knockdown lowers the level of dendritic Orco in an activity-dependent manner. **a** UAS-Dicer2/+ (X); UAS-mCH::Orco^WT/+(II); OR22a-Gal4, Orco^1 (III) control flies and **b** UAS-Dicer2/+ (X); UAS-mCH::Orco^WT/UAS-CaM RNAi(II); OR22a-Gal4, Orco^1(III) flies show only a slight to no difference in the dendritic level of Orco when they're reared without any odorant exposure. **c** and **d** But when they are exposed to EB for seven days, the difference in level of Orco in the dendrites between control and CaM RNAi flies becomes much more drastic. **c** Even though control flies also show reduction in level of dendritic Orco upon EB exposure, such reduction is much more drastic in **d** CaM RNAi flies, in which dendritic Orco is almost completely depleted. All images are visualization of the mCherry tag on Orco which has been converted to inverted black and white images. All scale bars: 10um.
