**Figure 6: CaM knock-down reduces dendritic Orco in an activity-dependent manner.**

**A.** The ab3A dendrites of [_UAS-Dcr-2/+ (X); UAS-mCherry::Orco<sup>WT</sup>/+ (II); Or22a-GAL4, Orco<sup>1</sup> (III)_] control flies show normal Orco localization, determine by visualizing mCherry.
**B.** The ab3A dendrites of [_UAS-Dcr-2/+ (X); UAS-mCherry::Orco<sup>WT</sup>/UAS-CaM-IR (II); Or22a-GAL4, Orco<sup>1</sup> (III)_] flies show only a slight reduction in dendritic Orco when they are maintained for 7 days on normal food.
**C--D.** Identical flies as in A and B maintained for 7 days in food vials containing a perforated 10% ethyl butyrate odor source.
**C.** Long-term odor exposure significantly reduces the level of dendritic Orco in control flies.
**D.** The combination of long-term odor exposure with CaM knock-down nearly eliminates ab3A dendritic Orco.
The color of all images is inverted to improve dendrite visibility.
