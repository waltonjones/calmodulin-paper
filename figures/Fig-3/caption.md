**Figure 3: Mutation of the Orco CBS disrupts the dendritic trafficking of Orco and Or47a.**

**A.** _UAS-mCherry::Orco<sup>WT</sup>/UAS-myR::GFP (II); Orco-GAL4, Orco<sup>1<sup> (III)_ flies show normal Orco localization in OSN cell bodies and dendrites (_left_) as well as normal dendritic morphology (_right_).
We confirmed this by visualization of mCherry and GFP, respectively.
**B.** Staining of _UAS-Orco<sup>WT</sup>/UAS-EGFP::OR47a (II); Orco-GAL4, Orco<sup>1<sup> (III)_ antennae with an anti-GFP antibody shows normal dendritic trafficking of OR47a.
**C--H.** We then similarly examined the localization of Orco and OR47a in flies expressing Orco^<sup>CBSΔ<sup> (**C--D**), Orco^<sup>W341Δ<sup> (**E--F**), and Orco^<sup>RH344EE<sup> (**G--H**).
For unknown reasons, perhaps increased degradation, the Orco CBS mutants all show lower mCherry signal than Orco^WT when imaged at the same confocal settings (**C, E, G _inset panels_**).
None of the three Orco CBS mutants rescue the dendritic localization of Orco (**C, E, G _left panels_**) despite showing normal dendritic morphology (**C, E, G _right panels_**).
Neither do the CBS mutants rescue dendritic localization of OR47a (**D, F, H**).
For **B**, **D**, **F**, and **H**, the color of each image is inverted to improve dendrite visibility.
