# Conclusion
Insects, both the beneficial and harmful alike, depend on their olfactory systems as they search for food and mates and as they avoid danger.
Insect olfaction, in turn, depends on the proper trafficking of Orco/OR complexes to the OSN dendrites where they encounter odor.
Using a variety of genetic tools, we discovered a previously unknown role for the calcium sensor Calmodulin as a modulator of Orco/OR trafficking.
CaM knock-down and introducing mutations in Orco's Calmodulin binding site both disrupt dendritic Orco/OR localization and olfactory responsiveness.
CaM's modulation of Orco is also OSN activity-dependent, in that prolonged odor exposures deplete dendritic Orco and magnify the importance of CaM-dependent dendritic Orco trafficking in maintaining olfactory sensitivity.
We expect our current study and future _in vivo_ studies like it will improve our understanding of the unique microenvironment of insect OSNs and someday make it possible to manipulate insect olfaction in ways beneficial to humanity.
