# Conclusion
Insects, beneficial and pests alike, depend on olfaction for search for food, recognition of mates, and avoidance of danger, and insect olfactory system function in turn depends on proper dendritic localization of ORs.
Since Orco is required for specific OR trafficking, studying modulation of Orco trafficking is vital in understanding, and eventually manipulating, insect olfaction.
We show that calcium signaling molecule CaM is a trafficking modulator of Orco.
Knocking down CaM at the onset of OSN development or mutating highly-conserved putative CBS within Orco results in a severe reduction or complete loss of dendritic Orco localization and proportion of responsive sensillum within the antenna.
Furthermore, such CaM-mediated Orco trafficking is OSN activity-dependent, where CaM activity becomes increasingly important in maintaining olfactory perception during an extended exposure to an odorant.
By using genetic tools and methods that allow studying CaM in its natural cellular environment, we uncovered a previously unknown modulatory role of CaM in Orco trafficking, underscoring the importance of _in vivo_ studies in studying the native role of a protein.
