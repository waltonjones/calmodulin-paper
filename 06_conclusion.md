# Conclusion
Insects, both the beneficial and harmful alike, depend on their olfactory systems as they search for food and mates and as they avoid danger.
Insect olfaction, in turn, depends on the proper trafficking of Orco/OR complexes to the OSN dendrites where they encounter odor.
We discovered the calcium sensor Calmodulin acts in OSNs as a modulator of Orco/OR trafficking.
CaM knock-down and introducing mutations in the Orco Calmodulin binding site both disrupt dendritic Orco/OR localization and olfactory responsiveness.
CaM's modulation of Orco is also OSN activity-dependent; prolonged odor exposures deplete dendritic Orco and CaM-dependent dendritic trafficking increasingly important in maintaining olfactory sensitivity.
By using genetic tools and methods that allow studying CaM in its natural cellular environment, we uncovered a previously unknown modulatory role of CaM in Orco trafficking, underscoring the importance of _in vivo_ studies in studying the native role of a protein.
Developing a clearer understanding of insect OR trafficking is vital in understanding, and eventually manipulating, insect olfaction.
