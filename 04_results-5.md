Figure 3 shows how _Peb-GAL4_-driven CaM knock-down, beginning 12--18 hours APF before Orco is expressed, dramatically reduces dendritic Orco/OR trafficking.
_Orco-GAL4_ expression begins around 80 hours APF when Orco expression begins \cite{Larsson_2004}.
When we used _Orco-GAL4_ to knock-down CaM, we observed no change in the electrophysiological dose-response curves for ab2A neurons responding to methyl acetate (Fig. 5A) and a small drop in the lower dose-responses for ab3A neurons responding to ethyl butyrate (Fig. 5B).
In contrast, ab2A neurons in CaM-depleted flies exposed to 7 days of 10% ethyl acetate, which activates ab2A, show a strong reduction in methyl acetate sensitivity at all doses (Fig. 5C). In this case, we used ethyl acetate instead of methyl acetate because methyl acetate evaporates too quickly, making long-term exposures difficult.
Similarly, ab3A neurons in CaM-depleted flies exposed to 7 days of 10% ethyl butyrate show a dramatic drop in sensitivity across all doses tested (Fig. 5D).
To determine whether this effect is OSN-specific, we exposed flies to 10% methyl hexanoate, which activates ab3A but not ab2A, and measured their sensitivity to either methyl acetate (ab2A) or ethyl butyrate (ab3A).
As expected, methyl hexanoate exposure only affects the sensitivity of the CaM-depleted ab3A neurons (Fig. 5E and F).
