# Discussion
In this study, we uncovered a previously unknown role for Calmodulin in concert with the olfactory co-receptor Orco in the trafficking of insect ORs to the ciliated dendrites of olfactory neurons.
We showed CaM knock-down in OSNs prior to their expression of ORs dramatically disrupts the dendritic trafficking of Orco, interfering with odor responsiveness (Fig. 1).
We next showed mutations in the putative Orco CBS completely block Orco and odor-specific OR trafficking (Fig. 2 and 3).

We next found long-term odor exposure seems to induce the movement of dendritic Orco into the cell bodies, presumably by inducing receptor internalization and subsequent recycling or degradation (Fig. 4).
Since OSN's depleted of CaM after OR expression begins show very little change in odor sensitivity, we wondered if the reduction in dendritic Orco induced by long-term odor exposure would increase the demand for CaM-induced Orco trafficking and hence accentuate the effect of CaM knock-down.
Indeed, we found this is the case; the combination of long-term odor exposure with CaM knock-down dramatically reduces odor sensitivity in an odor and OSN subtype-specific manner (Fig. 5).
This OSN activity-dependent reduction in odor sensitivity is, unsurprisingly, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in dendritic Orco localization (Fig. 6).
Thus, our results demonstrate a role for CaM in the dendritic trafficking of Orco/OR complexes.
This role for CaM is especially important when OSNs are subjected to prolonged odor exposure, because odor exposure seems to deplete dendritic Orco, necessitating the trafficking of additional Orco/OR complexes to the dendrites to maintain olfactory sensitivity.

Although we used relatively high odor concentrations for the long-term odor exposures in this study, but other published olfatory adaptation and habituation studies used similar or even higher concentrations and exposure durations \cite{Devaud_2001, Das_2011, Sachse_2007}.
We the actual concentration of odorant perceived by flies is lower due to the fact that odorants have to vaporize out of two layers of perforated tubes and become even more dilute upon diffusion throughout the vial.

Our results allow us a draw a model of olfactory receptor maintenance and dendritic trafficking where OR level is kept constant by two opposing forces: presence of ligands which causes reduction in amount of Orco at the dendrites, and binding of CaM to Orco which delivers Orco to the dendrites, thereby making up for the loss of dendritic Orco caused by odorant exposure.
This way, a constant level of Orco, and subsequently ORx, is maintained at its functional site of odorant recognition.

Even though previous studies have reported CaM's potential role as mediator of Orco activation and sensitization \cite{Mukunda_2014, Mukunda_2016}, we demonstrated, for the first time, CaM's role as an Orco trafficking modulator in _Drosophila_ OSNs. We further show that CaM is important in maintaining olfactory sensitivity in the antenna upon prolonged odorant exposure which depletes OSN dendrites of Orco. We find such activity-dependent regulation of Orco trafficking and maintenance of olfactory sensitivity in the antenna upon extended odor exposure reasonable when one considers the olfactory environment of flies. When flies first locate a whiff of a rotting fruit or a dangerous chemical, they must make appropriate behavioral adjustments depending on whether they find the olfactory source to be attractive or repulsive. However, as they start lingering or spending a longer period of time in a strongly aromatic environment, a form of adjustment occurs where an attractive or aversion behavior subsides. This is perhaps done initially by olfactory adaptation within the sensory neurons and then longer-lasting central adaptations in local interneurons and glomeruli \cite{10366618, 11487650, Das_2011}. But restoration and maintenance of normal of peripheral sensitivity in the antenna upon prolonged odorant exposure would be advantageous since it would allow flies to become quickly aware of the changes in their environment regardless of the strong odor already present, e.g. flying away from the fruit that they were eating and laying their eggs in, or finding an even more ripe, yeasty fruit in the close vicinity that can provide better environment for survival. Furthermore, not only is such maintenance of OSN response upon extended odor exposure important in remaining sensitive to the odor that the flies are already exposed to, but it can impact its sensitivity to other odors in general, since one type of insect OSN can recognize a wide range of odorants. Thus, if the olfactory sensitivity of a spcific OSN remains severely lowered upon prolonged exposure to an odor, it would also impair its ability to sense other odorants unrelated to the one it is exposed to. Thus, CaM may be important in maintaining a keen sensitivity to the extremely varied and dynamic olfactory environment despite the presence of an already strong source of odorant. 

Despite providing evidence of CaM's role in Orco trafficking, many questions remain to be answered.
For example, more investigation is needed to answer what other signaling pathways and molecules CaM and/or Orco interact with for proper OR trafficking to and from dendritic membranes.
Even though it's been known for a long time that Orco is required for proper surface expression of specific ORs \cite{Larsson_2004, Benton_2006}, how Orco couples specific OR to ciliary trafficking machinery is almost completely unknown.
Therefore, further study is required to answer what components make up such trafficking machinery in the OSNs, whether CaM binding somehow couples Orco to ciliary trafficking machinery and if so, how it brings about such coupling.

Furthermore, more in-depth observation of CaM's interaction with Orco, e.g. whether CaM stays bound to Orco throughout its expression, function, and eventual degradation or it delivers Orco/specific OR complex only up to a specific region in the dendritic segment and unbinds itself to travel back to the cell body to traffick more ORs, is necessary to understand ORs' expression in the OSN dendritic membrane. Such enhanced understanding of OR trafficking and expression in the dendritic membrane can eventually lead to improved OR expression and functional studies _in vitro_ through development of heterologous systems that more closely reflect the microenvironment of OSNs.
