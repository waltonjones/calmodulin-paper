# Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate a previously unknown role of CaM in insect OSNs by using genetic tools and experimental methods that allow us to study CaM in its natural physiological context at different developmental stages of OSNs _in vivo_.
CaM RNAi at the onset of OSN development and Orco putative CBS mutagenesis led to reduction or complete loss of Orco in OSN dendritic membranes and olfactory response measured by SSR (Fig.
1 and 3).

Then we further characterized CaM's role by showing that CaM modulates Orco trafficking in an OSN activity-dependent manner.
First we observed that the level of dendritic Orco is reduced upon prolonged exposure to an odorant in the absence of novel Orco expression (Fig 4).
Interestingly, in the presence of an odorant, even when most of the Orco was depleted in the dendrites, the OSN cell bodies showed a higher level of Orco localization.
This was significantly different from the depletion of Orco first in the cell bodies and then much more gradual degradation in the dendrites seen in control flies without any odorant exposure (Fig 4D) and in a similar experiment done by Benton _et al_. \cite{Benton_2006}.
Even though further study on Orco kinetics is necessary, we believe that one possibility of explaining such results is that odorant binding causes OR internalization and trafficking back into cell bodies, perhaps for further degradation or recycling.
Such ligand-induced internalization has been reported in several other classes of cell surface receptors trafficking of which are also modulated by CaM \cite{Lee_2008, Tebar_2002}.

Then we investigated the result of knocking down CaM in the presence or absence of extended exposure to an odorant. Remarkably, while late-onset knock-down of CaM using Orco-Gal4 in the absence of odorants led to no change or only a slight decrease in olfactory response in ab2A and ab3A neurons, knock-down of CaM during prolonged odorant exposure resulted in a dramatic loss of olfactory response (Fig. 5). Such reduction in olfactory response was characterized by severely diminished Orco localization in the OSN dendrites (Fig. 6). Therefore, our results indeed demonstrate that CaM, upon prolonged odor exposure, is crucial in maintaining a stable level of Orco/OR in the dendrites and normal olfactory response, perhaps because such exposure results in a depletion of dendritic Orco and necessitate enhanced Orco/OR trafficking.

Even though the condition of odorant exposure may seem drastic, similar or even higher concentrations of odorants and durations \cite{Devaud_2001, Das_2011, Sachse_2007} have been used in previous studies studying effects of prolonged odorant exposure in flies .
As noted in Devaud _et al_., the actual concentration of odorant perceived by flies is lower due to the fact that odorants have to vaporize out of two layers of perforated tubes and become even more dilute upon diffusion throughout the vial.

Our results allow us a draw a model of olfactory receptor maintenance and dendritic trafficking where OR level is kept constant by two opposing forces: presence of ligands which causes reduction in amount of Orco at the dendrites, and binding of CaM to Orco which delivers Orco to the dendrites, thereby making up for the loss of dendritic Orco caused by odorant exposure.
This way, a constant level of Orco, and subsequently ORx, is maintained at its functional site of odorant recognition.

Even though previous studies have reported CaM's potential role as mediator of Orco activation and sensitization \cite{Mukunda_2014, Mukunda_2016}, we demonstrated, for the first time, CaM's role as an Orco trafficking modulator in _Drosophila_ OSNs. We further show that CaM is important in maintaining olfactory sensitivity in the antenna upon prolonged odorant exposure which depletes OSN dendrites of Orco. We find such activity-dependent regulation of Orco trafficking and maintenance of olfactory sensitivity in the antenna upon extended odor exposure reasonable when one considers the olfactory environment of flies. When flies first locate a whiff of a rotting fruit or a dangerous chemical, they must make appropriate behavioral adjustments depending on whether they find the olfactory source to be attractive or repulsive. However, as they start lingering or spending a longer period of time in a strongly aromatic environment, a form of adjustment occurs where an attractive or aversion behavior subsides. This is perhaps done initially by olfactory adaptation within the sensory neurons and then longer-lasting central adaptations in local interneurons and glomeruli observed in flies exposed to a high concentration of odorants \cite{11487650, Das_2011}. But restoration and maintenance of normal of peripheral sensitivity in the antenna upon prolonged odorant exposure would be advantageous since it would allow flies to become quickly aware of the changes in their environment regardless of the strong odor already present, e.g. flying away from the fruit that they were eating and laying their eggs in, or finding an even more ripe, yeasty fruit in the close vicinity that can provide better environment for survival. This is probably even more crucial since one type of insect OSN can recognize a wide range of odorants. If the olfactory sensitivity of a spcific OSN is lowered upon prolonged exposure to an odor, it would severely impair its ability to sense other odorants unrelated to the one it is exposed to. Thus, CaM may be important in maintaining a keen sensitivity to the changing olfactory environment despite the presence of an already strong source of odorant. 

Despite providing evidence of CaM's role in Orco trafficking, many questions remain to be answered.
For example, more investigation is needed to answer what other signaling pathways and molecules CaM and/or Orco interact with for proper OR trafficking to and from dendritic membranes.
Even though it's been known for a long time that Orco is required for proper surface expression of specific ORs \cite{Larsson_2004, Benton_2006}, how Orco couples specific OR to ciliary trafficking machinery is almost completely unknown.
Therefore, further study is required to answer what components make up such trafficking machinery in the OSNs, whether CaM binding somehow couples Orco to ciliary trafficking machinery and if so, how it brings about such coupling.

Furthermore, more in-depth observation of CaM's interaction with Orco, e.g. whether CaM stays bound to Orco throughout its expression, function, and eventual degradation or it delivers Orco/specific OR complex only up to a specific region in the dendritic segment and unbinds itself to travel back to the cell body to traffick more ORs, is necessary to understand ORs' expression in the OSN dendritic membrane. Such enhanced understanding of OR trafficking and expression in the dendritic membrane can eventually lead to improved OR expression and functional studies _in vitro_ through development of heterologous systems that more closely reflect the microenvironment of OSNs.
