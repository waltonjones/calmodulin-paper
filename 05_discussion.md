# Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate a previously unknown role of CaM in insect OSNs by using genetic tools and experimental methods that allow us to study CaM in its natural physiological context at different developmental stages of OSNs _in vivo_.
CaM RNAi at the onset of OSN development and Orco putative CBS mutagenesis led to reduction or complete loss of Orco in OSN dendritic membranes and olfactory response measured by SSR (Fig.
1 and 2).

Then we further characterized CaM's role by showing that CaM modulates Orco trafficking in an OSN activity-dependent manner.
First we observed that the level of dendritic Orco is reduced upon prolonged exposure to an odorant in the absence of novel Orco expression (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Interestingly, in the presence of an odorant, even when most of the Orco was depleted in the dendrites, the OSN cell bodies showed a higher level of Orco localization.
This was significantly different from the depletion of Orco first in the cell bodies and then much more gradual degradation in the dendrites seen in control flies without any odorant exposure and in a similar experiment done by Benton _et al_. \cite{Benton_2006}.
Even though further study on Orco kinetics is necessary, one explanation of such results can be that odorant binding causes OR internalization and trafficking back into cell bodies, perhaps for further degradation or recycling.
Such ligand-induced internalization has been reported in several other classes of cell surface receptors trafficking of which are also modulated by CaM \cite{Lee_2008, Tebar_2002}.

It's been known from previous research that, while short-term exposure (scale of seconds to minutes) to an odor leads to reduced olfactory perception in the antenna and synaptic changes in the antennal lobe \cite{10366618, Das_2011}, prolonged exposure to an odorant leads to various synaptic and morphological changes in the brain, but not olfactory perception \cite{Devaud_2001, Das_2011, Sachse_2007}.
This implies that, as an odor exposure become drawn out, initial loss in olfactory sensitivity is restored and maintained in that state.
This observation, in combination with our results which demonstrate that the level of Orco at dendritic membrane constantly wears off upon extended odorant exposure, led us to hypothesize that CaM may function in maintaining normal olfactory response upon extended odor exposure by transducing the prolonged activity of OSNs into enhancement in rate of Orco trafficking to the dendrites.
Remarkably, while late-onset RNAi of CaM without any odorants led to no change or only a slight decrease in olfactory response in ab2A and ab3A neurons, RNAi of CaM during prolonged odorant exposure resulted in a dramatic loss of olfactory response (Fig. 4).
Such reduction in olfactory response was characterized by severely diminished Orco localization in the OSN dendrites (Fig. 5).
Therefore, our results indeed demonstrate that CaM, upon prolonged odor exposure, is crucial in maintaining a stable level of Orco-OrX in the dendrites and normal olfactory response.

Even though the condition of odorant exposure may seem drastic, similar or even higher concentrations of odorants and durations \cite{Devaud_2001, Das_2011, Sachse_2007} have been used in previous studies studying effects of prolonged odorant exposure in flies .
As noted in Devaud _et al_., the actual concentration of odorant perceived by flies is lower due to the fact that odorants have to vaporize out of two layers of perforated tubes and become even more dilute upon diffusion throughout the vial.

It has not escaped our attention that one of the odors that we used, MH, resulted in a decrease in olfactory response in ab3A neuron even without CaM knockdown (Fig.
4f).
This perhaps indicates that, depending on the nature of each invidual odorant or its interaction with ORx, reduction in sensory perception also occurs to a certain degree as an adaptive measure upon long-term exposure.
However, given the significant amount of additional reduction seen in CaM RNAi knockdown flies exposed to MH, it still appears quite clear that CaM is vital in maintaining what sensory perception is left even when it is not fully preserved after extended odor exposure.

Our results allow us a draw a model of olfactory receptor maintenance and dendritic trafficking where OR level is kept constant by two opposing forces: presence of ligands which causes reduction in amount of Orco at the dendrites, and binding of CaM to Orco which delivers Orco to the dendrites, thereby making up for the loss of dendritic Orco caused by odorant exposure.
This way, a constant level of Orco, and subsequently ORx, is maintained at its functional site of odorant recognition.

We demonstrated, for the first time, CaM's role as an Orco trafficking modulator in _Drosophila_ OSNs.
Even though previous studies have suggested CaM's potential role as mediator of Orco activation and sensitization \cite{Mukunda_2014, Mukunda_2016}, we uncovered a novel and critical role of CaM in establishing and maintaining a stable level of ORs in the OSN dendritic membrane. We believe that such an important role of CaM in insect OSNs went unnoted for several reasons. First of all, many of the experiments done in previous studies involved using heterologous expression system that is different from the natural microenvironment of OSNs.
Given that ORs, being membrane proteins, are not very well expressed in heterologous expression systems and even more poorly trafficked to the surface for proper functioning \cite{Seddon_2004}, such _in vitro_ methods may have been limited in exploring OR regulation and function in relation to CaM.
Also, despite Mukunda et al.'s attempts to relate their finding from heterologous expression systems to actual OSNs using _ex vivo_ methods \cite{Mukunda_2016}, we believe CaM's modulatory role in Orco trafficking that we observed was not noted because they examined the effects of inhibiting CaM for a short amount of time in adult flies. Our approach of examining CaM's modulation of Orco early on in OSN development and Orco expression allowed us to note the OR trafficking defects that occur without CaM. Furthermore, by extrapolating such findings to observe CaM's role later in OSN development in presence or absence of various odorants, we were able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of CaM's regulation of ORs by noting that CaM, during prolonged exposure to an odorant, helps maintain a stable level of olfactory perception in the antenna and ORs in the dendrites.
Thus, we believe our results show that, while _in vitro_ methods are valuable and informative especially when proper _in vivo_ methods are not available, _in vivo_ studies that examine a protein from the beginning of its expression and function in its natural cellular and lipid environment are vital to understand its native role.

Despite providing evidence of CaM's role in Orco trafficking, many questions remain to be answered.
For example, more investigation is needed to answer what other signaling pathways and molecules CaM and/or Orco interact with for proper OR trafficking to and from dendritic membranes.
Even though it's been known for a long time that Orco is required for proper surface expression of specific ORs \cite{Larsson_2004, Benton_2006}, how Orco couples specific OR to ciliary trafficking machinery is almost completely unknown.
Therefore, further study is required to answer what components make up such trafficking machinery in the OSNs, whether CaM binding somehow couples Orco to ciliary trafficking machinery and if so, how it brings about such coupling.

Furthermore, more in-depth observation of CaM's interaction with Orco, e.g. whether CaM stays bound to Orco throughout its expression, function, and eventual degradation or it delivers Orco/specific OR complex only up to a specific region in the dendritic segment and unbinds itself to travel back to the cell body to traffick more ORs, is necessary to understand ORs' expression in the OSN dendritic membrane. Such enhanced understanding of OR trafficking and expression in the dendritic membrane can eventually lead to improved OR expression and functional studies _in vitro_ through development of heterologous systems that more closely reflect the microenvironment of OSNs.
