To confirm the olfactory phenotypes induced by CaM knock-down are, indeed, a result of Orco malfunction, we decided to generate a series of transgenic fly lines for expressing versions of Orco carrying mutations in its putative CaM binding site.
Figure 2A shows a snake plot indicating Orco's predicted transmembrane domains and membrane topology.
To produce this plot, we created a multi-protein alignment using Orco orthologs from 78 different insect species and color-coded each amino acid based on its relative level of conservation.
The second intracellular loop of Orco contains a highly conserved stretch of amino acids that is likely a CaM binding site (CBS).
This region scores as high as possible in the multifactorial CBS prediction algorithm developed by Yap _et al_ \cite{12836676}.

Using PCR site-directed mutagenesis, we generated four Orco cDNAs containing different versions of the Orco CBS---the wild type version (Orco<sup>WT</sup>) as well as three others with mutations of varying severity.
These include deletions in the N and C termini (Orco<sup>CBSΔ</sup>), a single amino acid deletion (Orco<sup>W431Δ</sup>), and charge reversals of two positively charged residues (Orco<sup>RH344EE</sup>) (Fig. 2B).
We cloned each of these Orco variants into a UAS trangenesis vector modified to add an N-terminal mCherry tag to each resulting Orco protein.
Then, using standard fly transgenesis techniques and  site-specific recombination, we inserted each vector into the identical location on the second chromosome to match expression levels between variants.
